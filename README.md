I created a medium blog post to summarize the findings: https://medium.com/@chivalpham/analysis-of-the-effects-of-covid-19-in-asean-and-china-2020-2021-7fe5ace13824 

## Introduction
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

## Business Understanding
Based on the data that I collected from data.opendevelopmentmekong.net I deep dived into analysis in order to answer 3 main questions:

1. State of Affairs 2020–2021 in Vietnam
2. State of Affairs 2020–2021 in ASEAN and China
3. Which country resulted in the fastest spread of COVID-19?
